# Normal People

by Sally Rooney, 2018

## Plot

The story centers around Connell and Marianne. The chapters switch back and forth 
between their POV.

Connell is handsome and popular in school but has a rather lower-class background, whereas Marianne
comes from a rich family, is being mobbed and ostracized.

They start to have a relationship with each other in secret. Especially Connell is keen on
keeping it a secret, because he fears that otherwise he'd lose his social status in school.
Marianne plays along, as she has learnt all her life to submit to others, as she's
basically been taught to be worthless.

The relationship is an on and off thing throughout the book. They can't seem to communicate
to each other in a way that helps them stay together, yet both sort of feel that they
belong to each other. Both seem to only be themselves and a "fuller person" with the other.

Both go to Trinity college in Dublin, and the world is upended. Marianne is popular and
Connell has difficulties forming meaningful friendships. They end up together time and again,
but it never works out.
Marianne has a few abusive other relationships, whereas Connell has OK ones but never really
connects with the other women on a deeper level. Marianne solidifies her opinion of being
worthless through those abuses, yet she can always confide in Connell.

The whole thing spans over 4 years.

## Observations

* Interesting how the social hierarchy of school makes Connell act in a self-destructive manner.
* Interesting observations on how men aren't allowed to express feelings
* The relationship basically fails again and again because both parties can't really express
  their feelings for each other in a deeper, intimate level. Which is funny, because other
  topics and the sex seems to be *very* intimate.
* Connell has a frightening revelation after people find out about their relationship: it *didn't* 
  end his life as he'd expected it. He cared way to much about what others might think, leading
  to the downfall of his relationship with Marianne.
* Connell has difficulties connecting with the loud and expressive Dublin students. He himself
  has a rich inner life, and has and voices his own opinions and thoughts.
