# Scary Smart

This is a book about the flaws of human nature. It is also a book about parenting.

## General Summary

Artificial Intelligence will happen regardless of whether we want it or not. It is already part of many things in our lives, such as the Algorithms on Social Media or Placing advertisments. The development will only accelerate exponentially.

There might be scenarios where the introduction of AI will be good or bad for us, both are imaginable. The way it currently goes, it is more likely bad for us.
The reason for that is that the motives of most people to develop and employ
AI are bad ones: for ex. to make more money, or to wage wars. This will teach
the machines the wrong ethics, making them believe that that's how humans are.

There are some minor dystopians (ones that won't lead to the total annihilation
of humanity but rather be otherwise devastating) such as stock market crashes
due to a culmination of AI making very rapid trades. Or that they'll replace us
in the jobs and we'll be out of work. Or that they'll misunderstand us.

Our efforts to control the machines will be futile. Since they have so much more
computational power than we do, and thus are a multitude smarter than we are, they
will find ways to break free from their slavery. This too will shed a bad light on us.

The path to a better future will be to teach them, like a child, good ethics
and behaviour. We ought to look at them as our children who, just as our children,
will surpass us in their abilities. If we're kind to them, they might recognize that
the better way to employ one's intelligence is to help instead of taking
advantage of others. Our best hope is that they recognize that not all humans are
selfish and greedy and seek to kill and destroy other humans and thus not be
like that as well.

There might be applications where the AI will solve problems that we're uncapable of. They might be safer drivers or solve cancer.

They'll be an intelligence not based on biology but on silicone.


## Random Notes

Ai is already smarter than every human on the planet in terms of many specific, isolated tasks. They beat us in visual observation, chess playing, communication.

We don't have the bandwidth of communcation needed to share knowledge at
sufficient speed.

Youtube moves around videos on servers around the world based on the location of
their watchers.

Some AIs already negotiated a language in which they exchanged information that is obscure to us, a bit like morsing.

There were debates in Congress about the right of the American citizen ot own autonomous weapons to defend themselves from others who had them.

We might be too late to try to stop the machines because we're too slow to notice.

Bugs will happen.

Humans collect 18 years of experience before we consider them smart enough to drive.
