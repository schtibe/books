"An intimate portrait of Afghani people"

The book follows the observations and receptions of the stories around a family
in Afghanistan right after the fall of the Taliban Regime in 2001 (?).

The journalist had the opportunity to live and travel with the various members of the family.
Since she's a western woman, she had the privilege to be in both worlds, the men's as well as the
women's (in Afghanistan, the women and men eat in separate rooms).

The family is centered around Sultan, who's in his 50s, who owns a book shop in Kabul.
For Afghan standards, he seems to be a relatively "modern" and progressive man. But
still, the weird traditions of the country, especially with regards to the rights of
women are still very apparent in his family.

For instance is he the absolute decision maker. The others can't question his decisions.
He decides what his wife(s) and children are allowed to do, be it go to school or even
see someone. He also decides to have a second wife, who is about 16 at the time they're
marrying.

The book has chapters describing various stories usually centered around a member of the
family. Much of it is about the complicated courting process. The daughters are practically 
"sold" to a man based on his status, wealth and kinship. They themselves don't have a say
in it really. Yet both sexes have dreams and hopes for being with certain people. In
some cases they even go so far and meet each other secretly, which is strictly forbidden.

Interestingly, the people in the book are relieved of the Taliban having beeing overthrown.
Some of the older women remember a time when they didn't have to wear the Burka, and they
are looking forward to a future when finally they won't have to do it anymore.
Sultan the bookseller himself has been punished for carrying books in his shop, when the
Taliban were at power. Sometimes he's gone lengths to hide the forbidden books. He wants
to preserve the cultural history of Afghanistan with these books.
He also bootlegs books and postcards in Pakistan.

The family live in a derelict building which most of the time doesn't have
electricity. The all life in four rooms, whereas Sultan and his (second, the first
is sort of replaced, without really gaining any freedom) wife occupy one room, and the
mother, his brothers and sisters and his children all share the rest.

The youngest sister of his is only a few years older than his oldest son. The
son treats her disrespectfully. Through another chapter though we see his POV, where
he tries to break free himself from the obligation to work in his father's shop,
without having the possibility to go to school. Everyone in the book would like
to go to school, some may do it, some don't, depending on the Patron's will (in some
cases it's described through the eyes of a women who's married off to another man).

The youngest sister has never been alone in her life. When going out, (e.g. for shopping) 
she usually has to take a male with her. Since she's the youngest, she has the most
duties, doing many of the chores including having the breakfast ready when the others
wake.

All in all life is better now that the Taliban are away. They forbade many more
things than is usual in Afghanistan, including listening to music or dancing, not to
speak of the women not being able to work or go to school.
They also forbid any depiction of a living being, be it as an image or through the
story of a book. Luckily most of them are illiterate, so they were unable to tell
the books apart in Sultan's Shop.

## Afterthought

The book is a little over 20 years old that now that I've read it.
Sad to know that the whole efforts for the country were for naught, now that the
Taliban are back in power. It's especially sad to know that these backward
practices of marriage and women's rights still exist in todays age.
